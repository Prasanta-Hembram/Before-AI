**1. Purpose and Affordability**

*A set of questions to understand your primary interests to contribute to this project and how affordable it is for you to volunteer.*



***1.1 Why did you start contributing to Common Voice? What you plan to achieve through this project? What motivates you to contribute more?***



My initial goal was to improve access. Santali being a low-resource language does not yet have technologies such as text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT). I thought if I can contribute to improve voice data as it is required to built both STT and TTS, then it would be helpful to develop such technology later. Many monolingual Santali readers with visual disability currently do not have any form of access to information. They have all the right to such access. they should be able to but they do not have any means to rightful access to information.



I also like to volunteer in general and that drove me to contribute to Common Voice. It is addictive – I have felt like competing with myself and setting up goals. Seeing my own progress also is fulfilling.



***1.2 Who are the other contributors? What are their backgrounds? How did they join?***



Currently, myself, Suku Murmu and an anonymous user. I reached to many people. Of all the people who I reached out to, Suku Murmu, a Santali teacher from West Bengal showed interest. He gave really good feedback to improve the interface translation of the Common Voice web portal. He is also helping with the validation of recorded voice data.



***1.3 Can you share more about your overall contribution to this project? Share different parts of the project where you have contributed.***



I have contributed in sentence collection and proof-reading of collected sentences, localization of interface into Santali, recording of more than 300 sentences and validation of 214 sentences that others have recorded. Santali currently has 32 minutes of total voice data out of which 5:36 minutes of data is validated.



***1.4 How much time do you contribute on a weekly basis?***



Currently I spend about three hours every week. I started in January 2022 and even set goals for myself. But I could not succeed as there was no motivation for a lone contributor. When there are more number of contributors, there is a momentum and a sense of competition. That helps a lot.



***1.5 What would happen if you cannot contribute tomorrow for any reason?***



I think about that a lot. I am in touch with many others via Twitter and other social media platforms. I am reaching out many more and am encouraging others, including my own mother. She has in fact contributed many recordings already. She is currently contributing up to one-two hours every week for Common Voice. I am very confident that there are people to drive even if I become completely inactive tomorrow.



***1.6 Do you train others as well? How much extra time you spend for that?***



I did provide support to Suku. He is a part of an institution in West Bengal. They have showed interest to create a curriculum for digital literacy around Santali. I am preparing a video tutorial and a roadmap to for secondary level education. At the moment computing-related books are not available in Santali. Common Voice is one among the different open source projects that I am recommending to them.



***1.7 Anything you might want to share?***

 



**2. Hardware and platforms**

*Questions to understand how you contribute, what devices and other platforms you use.*



***2.1 What device do you use to contribute to Common Voice? Did you purchase this yourself or someone else got it for you?***



I just finished my undergraduate studies. I am using my phone that my parents got for me. I use it mostly as it gives me more flexibility. I do have a laptop but the microphone is not of good quality.



***2.2 Do you face any issues with your device such as overheating? How did you solve this issue if you ever faced?***



No issues with my phone so far.



***2.3 What amount of your total monthly data do you spend to contribute?***



About 800 Mb out of 45Gb on a monthly basis.



**3. Accessibility**

*Questions to understand your accessibility needs and issues while using Common Voice.*



***3.1 Did you face any issue while using the Common Voice platform? What are those issues? What could have been a better way?***



Yes, many contributors use their phone. Sometimes it fails to upload after they finish recording 5-10 sentences and shows an error. It demotivates when it fails like this. Similarly, with validation, there is no voice or there is a long delay. It is not clear what the issues are. Each sentence should be uploaded immediately instead of uploading a batch of 5 sentences. Low bandwidth might see their efforts being wasted with the batch uploading option. If there can be a backend program to inform the uploader that there contribution includes only background noise and no human voice. This can be my mistake and the uploader might not have reviewed. Flagging to the users during the time of uploading can save collective time. There can also be a mock round for all new users to record and validate.



Other option can also be cleaning up and editing before editing. Some advanced users can do it.



Sometimes website also crashes. I know about this issues but don’t know how to solve this.



***3.2 Is the background colour, font size of text, translation of everything you see clear? What do you feel should be changed to make things easier for you?***



All good, I like how it is now. Windows 11 has some issues with a particular character “j” because of which all websites see this issue. Many users might mistake this as an issue of a platform.



**SENTENCE COLLECTION**



There was no Public Domain licensed sentences. I started a GitHub repo. Three of us managed to gather 2,000 sentences. Aryan, Ashwani and myself. Total 6,000. I have contributed 4,000. I wish they change to CC-BY CC-BY-SA so that we can bring from Wikipedia and Vikaspedia.



Alternative could have been going to uni and requesting teachers. 



***Did you have time?***



There are only a few of us volunteers.



**PRIVACY**

People are fearful of privacy. They fear if anyone can misuse their voice. I have tried to explain to people but there is low awareness among people.



**DIVERSITY**

Not much. I think it would be something to discuss and frame a guidelines as the community grow. I am making a video tutorial to help new contributors.



THINGS TO IMPROVE

As ours is an indigenous language that is written in multiple writing systems, there is always a challenge what the default writing system would be. Many other indigenous languages with writing systems have the same issue. Community-level discussions on Discord and a consensus is required.



Accent: There was a question from Mozilla but I could not respond as there are no official or standard name for different accents. Questions should allow details to be shared from the community.
